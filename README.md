# Minimal Weather App

## Reason for Creation

I am currently in the process of learning Flutter and I wanted to create a weather app as this would be a good way to learn the basics around understanding how to make API requests and displaying them uniquely 

## What occurs in this project?

In this project, I make use of the openweathermap API to get data about the weather based on the location of the user. I got the location of the user utilising the geocoding and geolocator package that can be downloaded into Flutter. After using geocoding I pass the latitudes and longitudes into the geolocator to find the city, and then pass this into the API, returning the values I required that were:
- Conditions (Cloudy, Overcast, Thunderstorm, etc)
- Temperature
  - Maximum
  - Minimum
  - Actual Temperature
  - Feels Like (as often this is what people will be experiencing outside)

Additionally to this, I have added the functionality for the background of the app to change based on the hour of the day, such as when it is before midday the app's background will display a yellow-orange colour, when it is between 12:00pm and 5:00pm it will display a blue-grey and blue background and when it is night it will showcase a yellow and purple background as seen in the picture below. 


## What more might be there?

If I do come back to this project (currently as of writing this the motivation is quite high ðŸ˜…) I would like to implement a feature that would allow for a navigation bar at the bottom with a home page (which would be the temperature of your location) but another page called "Other" wherein you would be able to see other locations weather (which you would have saved as favourites)

## What the App looks like
